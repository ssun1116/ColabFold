+ 2022/07/13: We have set up a new ColabFold MSA server provided by Korean Bioinformation Center. 
+             It provides accelerated MSA generation, we updated the UniRef30 to 2022_02 and PDB/PDB70 to 220313.

### FAQ
- Where can I chat with other ColabFold users?
  - See our [Discord](https://discord.gg/gna8maru7d) channel!
- Can I use the models for **Molecular Replacement**?
  - Yes, but be **CAREFUL**, the bfactor column is populated with pLDDT confidence values (higher = better). Phenix.phaser expects a "real" bfactor, where (lower = better). See [post](https://twitter.com/cheshireminima/status/1423929241675120643) from Claudia Millán.
- What is the maximum length?
  - Limits depends on free GPU provided by Google-Colab `fingers-crossed`
  - For GPU: `Tesla T4` or `Tesla P100` with ~16G the max length is ~1400
  - For GPU: `Tesla K80` with ~12G the max length is ~1000
  - To check what GPU you got, open a new code cell and type `!nvidia-smi`
- Is it okay to use the MMseqs2 MSA server (`cf.run_mmseqs2`) on a local computer?
  - You can access the server from a local computer if you queries are serial from a single IP. Please do not use multiple computers to query the server.
- Where can I download the databases used by ColabFold?
  - The databases are available at [colabfold.mmseqs.com](https://colabfold.mmseqs.com)
- I want to render my own images of the predicted structures, how do I color by pLDDT?
  - In pymol for AlphaFold structures: `spectrum b, red_yellow_green_cyan_blue, minimum=50, maximum=90`
  - In pymol for RoseTTAFold structures: `spectrum b, red_yellow_green_cyan_blue, minimum=0.5, maximum=0.9`
- What is the difference between the AlphaFold2_advanced and AlphaFold2_mmseqs2 (_batch) notebook for complex prediction? 
  - We currently have two different ways to predict protein complexes: (1) using the AlphaFold2 model with residue index jump and (2) using the AlphaFold2-multimer model. AlphaFold2_advanced supports (1) and AlphaFold2_mmseqs2 (_batch) (2).
- What is the difference between localcolabfold and the pip installable colabfold_batch?
  -  localcolabfold is a command line interface for our advanced notebooks. pip is a command line version of the alphafold_mmseqs2 and alphafold_batch notebook.


### Running locally

_Note: Checkout [localcolabfold](https://github.com/YoshitakaMo/localcolabfold) too

Install ColabFold using the `pip` commands below. `pip` will resolve and install all required dependencies and ColabFold should be ready within a few minutes to use. Please check the [JAX documentation](https://github.com/google/jax#pip-installation-gpu-cuda) for how to get JAX to work on your GPU or TPU.

```shell
pip install "colabfold[alphafold] @ git+https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold"
pip install -q "jax[cuda]>=0.3.8,<0.4" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
# For template-based predictions also install kalign and hhsuite
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda kalign2=2.04 hhsuite=3.3.0
# For amber also install openmm and pdbfixer
conda install -c conda-forge openmm=7.5.1 pdbfixer
```

```shell
colabfold_batch <directory_with_fasta_files> <result_dir> 
```

If no GPU or TPU is present, `colabfold_batch` can be executed (slowly) using only a CPU with the `--cpu` parameter.

### Generating MSAs for large scale structure/complex predictions

First create a directory for the databases on a disk with sufficient storage (940GB (!)). Depending on where you are, this will take a couple of hours: 

```shell
./setup_databases.sh /path/to/db_folder
```

Download and unpack mmseqs (Note: The required features aren't in a release yet, so currently, you need to compile the latest version from source yourself or use a [static binary](https://mmseqs.com/latest/mmseqs-linux-avx2.tar.gz)). If mmseqs is not in your `PATH`, replace `mmseqs` below with the path to your mmseqs:

```shell
# This needs a lot of CPU
colabfold_search input_sequences.fasta /path/to/db_folder msas
# This needs a GPU
colabfold_batch msas predictions
```

This will create intermediate folder `msas` that contains all input multiple sequence alignments formated as a3m files and a `predictions` folder with all predicted pdb,json and png files. 

Searches against the ColabFoldDB can be done in two different modes:

(1) Batch searches with many sequences against the ColabFoldDB quires a machine with approx. 128GB RAM. The search should be performed on the same machine that called `setup_databases.sh` since the database index size is adjusted to the main memory size. To search on computers with less main memory delete the index by removing all `.idx` files, this will force MMseqs2 to create an index on the fly in memory. MMSeqs2 is optimized for large input sequence sets sizes. For batch searches use the `--db-load-mode 0` option.

(2) single query searches require the full index (the .idx files) to be kept in memory. This can be done with e.g. by using [vmtouch](https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch). Thus, this type of search requires a machine with at least 768GB RAM for the ColabfoldDB. If the index is in memory use to `--db-load-mode 3` parameter in `colabfold_search` to avoid index loading overhead. If they database is already in memory use `--db-load-mode 2` option.

**OLD Updates**
```diff
  11Mar2022: We use in default AlphaFold-multimer-v2 weights for complex modeling. 
             We also offer the old complex modes "AlphaFold-ptm" or "AlphaFold-multimer-v1"
  04Mar2022: ColabFold now uses a much more powerful server for MSAs and searches through the ColabFoldDB instead of BFD/MGnify. 
             Please let us know if you observe any issues.
  26Jan2022: AlphaFold2_mmseqs2, AlphaFold2_batch and colabfold_batch's multimer complexes predictions are 
             now in default reranked by iptmscore*0.8+ptmscore*0.2 instead of ptmscore
  16Aug2021: WARNING - MMseqs2 API is undergoing upgrade, you may see error messages.
  17Aug2021: If you see any errors, please report them.
  17Aug2021: We are still debugging the MSA generation procedure...
  20Aug2021: WARNING - MMseqs2 API is undergoing upgrade, you may see error messages.
             To avoid Google Colab from crashing, for large MSA we did -diff 1000 to get 
             1K most diverse sequences. This caused some large MSA to degrade in quality,
             as sequences close to query were being merged to single representive.
             We are working on updating the server (today) to fix this, by making sure
             that both diverse and sequences close to query are included in the final MSA.
             We'll post update here when update is complete.
  21Aug2021  The MSA issues should now be resolved! Please report any errors you see.
             In short, to reduce MSA size we filter (qsc > 0.8, id > 0.95) and take 3K
             most diverse sequences at different qid (sequence identity to query) intervals 
             and merge them. More specifically 3K sequences at qid at (0→0.2),(0.2→0.4),
             (0.4→0.6),(0.6→0.8) and (0.8→1). If you submitted your sequence between
             16Aug2021 and 20Aug2021, we recommend submitting again for best results!
  21Aug2021  The use_templates option in AlphaFold2_mmseqs2 is not properly working. We are
             working on fixing this. If you are not using templates, this does not affect the
             the results. Other notebooks that do not use_templates are unaffected.
  21Aug2021  The templates issue is resolved!
  11Nov2021  [AlphaFold2_mmseqs2] now uses Alphafold-multimer for complex (homo/hetero-oligomer) modeling.
             Use [AlphaFold2_advanced] notebook for the old complex prediction logic. 
  11Nov2021  ColabFold can be installed locally using pip!
  14Nov2021  Template based predictions works again in the Alphafold2_mmseqs2 notebook.
  14Nov2021  WARNING "Single-sequence" mode in AlphaFold2_mmseqs2 and AlphaFold2_batch was broken 
             starting 11Nov2021. The MMseqs2 MSA was being used regardless of selection.
  14Nov2021  "Single-sequence" mode is now fixed.
  20Nov2021  WARNING "AMBER" mode in AlphaFold2_mmseqs2 and AlphaFold2_batch was broken 
             starting 11Nov2021. Unrelaxed proteins were returned instead.
  20Nov2021  "AMBER" is fixed thanks to Kevin Pan
